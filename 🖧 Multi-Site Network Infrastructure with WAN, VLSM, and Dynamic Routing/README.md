# 🖧 Multi-Site Network Infrastructure with WAN, VLSM, and Dynamic Routing

Welcome to the **Multi-Site Network Infrastructure with WAN, VLSM, and Dynamic Routing** project! 🌐 This repository demonstrates a professional and scalable network architecture built with **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a robust network infrastructure for a company with **two interconnected sites** linked via a **WAN connection**. Key configurations include:
- **VLSM Segmentation** - Efficient IP address allocation.
- **Dynamic Routing (RIP)** - Simplified route updates between networks.
- **Default Routes** - WAN traffic routing using **public IPv4 addresses**.
- **DMZ Zones** - Secure hosting for DNS, HTTP, FTP, and Mail servers.
- **DHCP Pools** - Automated IP address distribution.
- **SSH Configuration** - Secure remote management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** - Network design and simulation.
- **VLSM** - Optimized subnetting and IP allocation.
- **RIP Protocol** - Dynamic routing for seamless updates.
- **DHCP** - Automated address assignment.
- **SSH** - Encrypted remote administration.
- **DMZ Zones** - Secure environments for critical services.

## 📝 Usage Instructions
1. Open the `.pkt` file in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Review the network topology and test connectivity.
3. Verify server accessibility (DNS, HTTP, FTP, Mail) and SSH configuration.
